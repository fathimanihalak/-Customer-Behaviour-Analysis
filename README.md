✅ Project Workflow

🔹 1. Data Cleaning — Python

Performed preprocessing to make the dataset analysis-ready:
Removed duplicates
Handled missing values
Standardized column formats
Corrected inconsistent category labels
Converted data types (numeric, dates)
Exported cleaned dataset to CSV

Libraries Used:
pandas
numpy

🔹2. Data Load to SQL
The cleaned dataset was imported into SQL Server
Table Name → CustomerData
Database → customer_behaviour

🔹 3. SQL Analysis

Key insights were extracted using SQL queries:

✔ Revenue difference between male & female customers
✔ Discount usage vs customer spending
✔ Top products by ratings & sales
✔ Customer segmentation
✔ Subscription & loyalty analysis
✔ Category-wise product performance
✔ Age-wise revenue contribution

Queries used are available inside this repo.

🔹 4. Power BI Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
Revenue by Category
Subscription vs. Revenue
Customer Segmentation
Purchase behavior by Location
Top products
Seasonal trends

📊 Key Insights
Customers using discounts still spend significantly
Loyal buyers contribute major revenue
Electronics & Clothing categories dominate sales
Express shipping customers tend to spend slightly more
Higher review ratings correlate with repeated purchases
